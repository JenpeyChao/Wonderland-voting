# Wonderland-voting
A database for voting for ballots for individuals living in Wonderland <br />
There are places, they can be residential or voting centers <br />
Individuals can work at voting centers as a administrator, monitor, judge, or clerk <br />
There are schedules for voting centers and individuals who are working <br />
there are ballots assigned to voting centers at a certain date and ends at a certain date <br />
And then individuals need to register to vote, but individuals can register multiple times but can vote once <br />
