# Wonderland-voting
A database for voting for ballots for individuals living in Wonderland
There are places, they can be residential or voting centers
Individuals can work at voting centers as a administrator, monitor, judge, or clerk
There are schedules for voting centers and individuals who are working
there are ballots assigned to voting centers at a certain date and ends at a certain date
And then individuals need to register to vote, but individuals can register multiple times but can vote once
